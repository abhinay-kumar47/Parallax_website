Project Name: Parallax Website

Overview
This project is a stunning Parallax Website that aims to provide a captivating and immersive user experience through the use of parallax scrolling effects. Parallax scrolling is a web design technique where background images move slower than foreground images, creating a sense of depth and enhancing the visual appeal of the website.

Features
1. Parallax Scrolling
Immerse your users in a visually engaging experience with smooth parallax scrolling effects. As users navigate through the website, background images subtly move at different speeds, creating a 3D-like effect.

2. Responsive Design
Ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different resolutions and providing an optimal viewing experience for both desktop and mobile users.

3. Interactive Sections
Enhance user engagement with interactive sections that respond to user actions. Incorporate elements that react to mouse movements, clicks, or scrolls, adding an extra layer of interactivity to the overall design.

4. Customizable Content
Easily customize the content of your website to suit your needs. Update text, images, and other elements through a user-friendly interface, making it simple to maintain and modify the website according to your preferences.
